# Face-Mask-detection-through-email-warning

**Objective:** Detecting masks over faces in a location to avoid the spread of Coronavirus is developed using deep learning models. The proposed model efficiently addresses varying kinds of occlusions in dense situations The combined approach not only helps in achieving high accuracy but also improves detection speed extensively. The model is almost 100% accurate at mask detection with average inference times of 0.10 seconds per image.

**Outcome:** The model will predict the possibility of each of the two classes (without_mask, with_mask). Based on which likelihood is higher, the label will be chosen and indicated around our faces through a rectangular indicator and if a mask is not detected then it will send an alert to the registered email stating “No Mask Detected”. The interference in photos taken is less to reduce delay in capturing mask.

**Key skills:** OpenCV, CNN, Keras, Tensorflow
